					<h3>BuildSys2023</h3>
				</header>
				 <p> I had the opportunity to attend the 10th ACM International Conference on Systems for Energy-Efficient Buildings, Cities, and Transportation 🏙️, which took place in the beautiful (no bias introduced!) and historic city of Istanbul, Türkiye this year!

		                <div id="extendedContent1" style="display:none;">
		                    <p>I have also had a chance to attend two workshops: 🌐 IEA EBC Annex 81 'Data-Driven Smart Buildings' Workshop on Smart Building-to-Grid Services and Applications (B2G'23), and 🔗 International Workshop on Cyber-Physical-Social Infrastructure Systems (CPSIS'23). </p>
				    <p>Attending both the main conference and workshops was an electrifying ⚡ experience filled with innovative ideas and groundbreaking discussions! The best part? Getting to meet with experts who share a similar passion for decarbonization efforts. 🤝  </p>
				    <p>Additionally, I had the opportunity to present our paper with Mario Bergès 'Unmasking the Thermal Behavior of Single-Zone Multi-Room Houses: An Empirical Study'. 📊🏠 </p>
				     <p>Plus, I got to be the cultural ambassador and showcase a slice of my expertise about Türkiye to my fellow colleagues! 🇹🇷 They were surprised to see a city where it 'actually' rains cats and dogs outside! 🐈 </p>
