                <p>Just got back from a fantastic gathering of minds at the High Performance Buildings Conference and the Intelligent Building Operations Workshop (IBO) at Herrick Labs, Purdue University! I had the pleasure of presenting our "beyond-average" paper, which was nominated for the best student paper‚Äîquite the thrill!</p>

                <p>I had the opportunity to attend the 10th ACM International Conference on Systems for Energy-Efficient Buildings, Cities, and Transportation üèôÔ∏è, which took place in the beautiful (no bias introduced!) and historic city of Istanbul, T√ºrkiye this year!</p>

                <div id="extendedContent1" style="display:none;">
                    <p>I have also had a chance to attend two workshops: üåê IEA EBC Annex 81 'Data-Driven Smart Buildings' Workshop on Smart Building-to-Grid Services and Applications (B2G'23), and üîó International Workshop on Cyber-Physical-Social Infrastructure Systems (CPSIS'23).</p>
                    <p>Attending both the main conference and workshops was an electrifying ‚ö° experience filled with innovative ideas and groundbreaking discussions! The best part? Getting to meet with experts who share a similar passion for decarbonization efforts. ü§ù</p>
                    <p>Additionally, I had the opportunity to present our paper with Mario Berg√®s 'Unmasking the Thermal Behavior of Single-Zone Multi-Room Houses: An Empirical Study'. üìäüè†</p>
                    <p>Plus, I got to be the cultural ambassador and showcase a slice of my expertise about T√ºrkiye to my fellow colleagues! üáπüá∑ They were surprised to see a city where it 'actually' rains cats and dogs outside! üêà</p>
